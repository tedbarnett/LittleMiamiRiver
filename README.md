# LittleMiamiRiver
A Blender 3.5.2 project

Animating local fish and creatures from the Little Miami River in Loveland, Ohio

This animation will be used to generate two contiguous 10-minute looping videos.  These two videos will be projected onto the floor of a restaurant to simulate a live "river" with fish swimming through it.  Two individual projectors will be used to create a single longer image of the river.

Specs for the project are captured in the [Issues List for this repository](https://github.com/tedbarnett/LittleMiamiRiver/issues).  They are organized into prioritized Milestones.
