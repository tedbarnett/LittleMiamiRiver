# LittleMiamiRiver
Blender 3 project

Animating local fish from the Little Miami River in Loveland, Ohio

This animation will be used to generate two contiguous 10-minute looping videos.  These two videos will be projected onto the floor of a restaurant to simulate a live "river" with fish swimming through it.  Two individual projectors will be used to create a single longer image of the river.
